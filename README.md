newVisions assesment

My goal with the assignment was to first to bring the json into my index Next parse the data and store the information in a variable called theParse the groupByGrade function takes a parameter of year My goal was to loop through every item or object in the array and see if the grade object matched the year I put as my arguument for the parameter year.

I did struggle with the assesment but it was a good challenge to improve my skills. I would like to be taught how to complete this assesment to improve my Json experience
